# **DistanceCalculator API**
### Calculates distance between two points.

*********************************************

This API offers two ways of calculating the distance between two points on the surface of the Earth.

#### Calculates distance based on the Spherical Law of Cosines

**According to Wikipedia:** "In spherical trigonometry, the law of cosines (also called the cosine rule for sides) is a theorem relating the sides and angles of spherical triangles, analogous to the ordinary law of cosines from plane trigonometry."

Formula: cos p = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos φ

####  Calculates distance using ‘Pythagorean theorem’ formula

**According to Wikipedia:** "Geographical distance is the distance measured along the surface of the earth. The formulae in this article calculate distances between points which are defined by geographical coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. This distance is an element in solving the second (inverse) geodetic problem."

#### Techincal API Design

The API was build using C# .Net Core.
